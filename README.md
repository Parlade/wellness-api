# Wellness-API

Wellness-API is an Express app where we do a CRUD from invoices.

## Tech

wellness-api uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [mongoDB] - nonSQL database

And of course wellnes-ap itself is open source with a [public repository][wellnes-api]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

wellnes-api requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

We need to have an instance of MongoDB running on our PC.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd wellness-api
npm i
npm start
```
